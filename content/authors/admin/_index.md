Greetings! I am an incoming tenure-track assistant professor in the computer science department at the [Univerity of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu/) since 2022 Fall.  Now I am a senior research scientist at the Samsung Research AI center (Mountain View, CA). I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Indiana University in 2019 and 2021, respectively. 

My research focuses on improving the efficiency, privacy and security of deep learning on both computer vison and natural langugage processing tasks by designing novel algorithms, models, and systems. 
<!-- I recently put efforts into the intersection of machine learning and security/privacy, i.e., privacy-preserving machine learning based on private primitives, e.g., Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Multi-Party Computation, Differential privacy, etc. -->
